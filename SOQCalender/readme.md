# üéì SOQ Calendar Automation

Automate the generation of **Student Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ)** calendar dates for each academic term ‚Äî directly from the BlueCourses export data.  
This repository includes scripts and documentation to streamline how WCC‚Äôs CiTL prepares official SOQ Date documents each semester.

## üìò Overview

This project extracts, organizes, and formats **Part of Term (POT)** data and corresponding **evaluation (SOQ)** dates.  
It produces:
- A clean **Excel file** summarizing all key dates per semester  
- A **formatted Word document** ready for publication on faculty and dean dashboards

## üß† How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Extraction (`_Codetoextract.ipynb`)
- Reads the exported **BlueCourses.csv** file from the O drive:
- Filters rows by semester (e.g. `"Spring/Summer 2025"`)
- Groups by **Part Of Term**
- Aggregates:
- Course Start / End Dates  
- SOQ (Evaluation) Start / End Dates  
- Outputs a clean file: NEWSOQCalender.xlsx
